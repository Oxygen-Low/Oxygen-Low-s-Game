# Oxygen Low's Game
An online multiplayer platform, where you can create your own games, for free!
## Read!
This is currently in closed beta access. 

You may request to join via our Discord.

Playtests will occassionally become live, and we will showcase some of the amazing creations everyone submits.

(We don't have any 24/7 servers, so I will be running the game server on my computer + the website and auth system).

If you wish to create your own session, you can install our server, which we will be releasing when we come out of closed beta access.
